# My Bookshelve

This project was created for The Odin Project Javascript course. This particular project represents roughly 16hrs of work, and despite some struggles I feel confident in what I am learning. I also took this project to work on my code layout, and practice best practices.

**Styling**

I chose to go with a card style design, this time using Bulma. I also chose to stick with a single column stack approach. I decided on this, as I felt it provides a clean scroll through the items and lends itself the ability to work well in mobile settings. 

**Expansion**

I have intentions of revisiting this project to add user login and storage options, as well I would like to include the ability to fetch cover art and book details from Play Books.
