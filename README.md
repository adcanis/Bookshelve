# The Bookshelve

This project was created for The Odin Project Javascript course. 
I chose to create a card style layout using Bulma.
Local storage has not been set up yet but will be added. 

I will say, this was so far the toughest project as I have been finding Javascript to be a bit more challanging than I thought. I am currently taking the Colt Steele Bootcamp at the same time, and find the combination of the two courses help my understanding immensely. 

This project ended up taking me roughly 16hrs to complete, and I will be revisiting this one to expand on it. Future goals for the library will support fetching Play Book covers and details for entered books.
